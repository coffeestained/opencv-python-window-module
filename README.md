# opencv-python-window-module
In-progress re-factoring previous efforts in my exploration of OpenCV. The core loads a window of choice. An in memory x, y map is created in relation to the entire screen/viewport. Models can be loaded in. Bounding boxes are generated and applied to the screen/viewport map.

More to come as requirements are built discovered.
